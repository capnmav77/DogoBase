# DogoBase

Welcome to **DogoBase**! üêï DogoBase is a simple key-value database being developed in Python. Right now, our focus is on building a very basic, minimal database that works on a single machine. This project is being built by two friends, **DL Rameshwar** and **Avanish Shenoy**, as a fun learning exercise during Hacktoberfest.

## About the Project

DogoBase is a key-value database that will start with just the basics. Our goal is to keep it extremely simple in the beginning, with limited functionality, and gradually expand it by adding more features over time.

Right now, DogoBase is a **learning project** where we‚Äôre aiming to:
- Understand how databases work internally.
- Build something from scratch with Python.
- Experiment and add features as we learn more.

## Current Features

At this stage, DogoBase will be really simple, focusing only on:
- **Basic in-memory key-value storage** on a single machine.

It‚Äôs not meant for production use right now, but it‚Äôs a good start for learning and experimenting.

## Future Plans

We‚Äôre planning to gradually add more features to DogoBase, including:
- **Persistent storage**: Store data to disk so that it survives restarts.
- **Multi-machine support**: Eventually allow the database to work in a distributed system.
- **More complex queries**: Go beyond simple key-value storage to include filtering, sorting, etc.
- **Backup and restore**: Allow users to save and restore their database.
- **Performance optimization**: Make the database faster and more efficient.

As we keep building, DogoBase will evolve into something more powerful, step by step.
